# magic8ball
a magic 8 ball i made to learn about processing and objects 

Running:
- from cmd line : processing-java --sketch=/full/path/to/sketch/magic8ball --run
- from processing : click the run button 

Controls:
Just click to shake

Written using Processing (Processing.org)
Was made in about a day, wanted to learn a bit about graphics so chose Processing. 
I also did this to get an idea of what an object was before taking Object Oriented
Programming (CIS*2430) .
I hope to make a more involved game later this year.
