# magic8ball
a magic 8 ball i made to learn about processing and objects 

Written using Processing (Processing.org)
Was made in about a day, wanted to learn a bit about graphics so chose Processing. 
I also did this to get an idea of what an object was before taking Object Oriented
Programming (CIS*2430) .
I hope to make a more involved game later this year.
